## Introduction

Web applications are complex systems that require thorough testing to ensure they function as expected and are secure from threats. This checklist is designed to cover a wide range of potential issues, from security vulnerabilities to usability problems, helping you to deliver a robust and secure web application.

## Checklist Categories

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Login and Logout:**
  - Ensure protection against brute force attacks.
  - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in login forms.
  - Verify proper session invalidation after logout.

- **Password Policies:**
  - Enforce strong password policies.
  - Ensure secure storage of passwords (e.g., hashed and salted).

- **Authorization:**
  - Prevent unauthorized access to resources.
  - Test for horizontal and vertical privilege escalation.

### Session Management

- **Session ID Security:**
  - Ensure session IDs are complex, unique, and securely generated.
  - Regenerate session IDs upon login.

- **Session Expiry:**
  - Implement session expiration after inactivity.

- **Secure Cookies:**
  - Mark session cookies as `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.

### Input Validation

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
  - Test for reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.

- **SQL Injection:**
  - Ensure input fields are protected against SQL injection.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
  - Verify CSRF tokens are used for state-changing requests.

- **File Uploads:**
  - Validate and sanitize file uploads.
  - Store uploaded files securely, ensuring they are non-executable.

### Data Handling

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Validate and sanitize data before processing.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Prevent error messages from exposing sensitive information.

### Business Logic

- **Workflow Bypasses:**
  - Test for ways to bypass critical steps in business processes.

- **Race Conditions:**
  - Check for issues when multiple users interact with the same object or process simultaneously.

- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Ensure rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.

### User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure the application is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Verify that the application meets accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

- **Error Messages:**
  - Provide clear and user-friendly error messages.

- **Navigation:**
  - Ensure that navigation is intuitive and consistent across the application.

### Performance and Scalability

- **Load Testing:**
  - Conduct load testing to identify performance bottlenecks.

- **Caching:**
  - Implement appropriate caching strategies to improve performance.

- **Database Optimization:**
  - Optimize database queries and indexing for efficiency.

### Compliance and Legal

- **Data Privacy:**
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

- **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:**
  - Provide clear and accessible terms of service and privacy policy documents.

- **Cookie Consent:**
  - Implement cookie consent mechanisms as required by law.
